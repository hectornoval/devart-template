## Description

Homage to Jean Tinguely homage to Kasimir Malevich. Undeterminated surface box with seven geometric shapes in pure white. 
The elements rotate at different speeds producing an ongoing series of new compositions. Each image is new and virtually unrepeatable. 

Art evolves trough technology. Jean Tinguely redid Malevich paint with 'movement' so it would become infinite. I updated his work with our technology so it wouldn't have the constraints of format.
