Jean Tinguely - Homage to Kasimir Malevich - 1954

"Métamatic and Métaméchanique – In the work of Jean Tinguely (Swiss, 1925 – ), machines programmed electronically to act with antimechanical unpredictability, jerking erraticly, sometimes scribbling on rolls of paper."
[From: Artlex.com]

"I am an artist of movement. Initially I did painting but I got blocked there, I found myself stuck. I was handicapped by the whole history of art and the Ecole des Beaux Arts. I got hung up in the pictures, on the pictures – finally all I could do is wait until they were tired; I could never find their end. So I decided to introduce movement."
Tinguely, 1982
