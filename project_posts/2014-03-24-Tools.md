Choosing the tools -

Suprematism found its base in the application and simplification of the fundamental geometric forms. I thought that to keep the process consistent in terms of 'concept' right up to the end the best way was to use basic coding languages. So I decided to build the méta-méta just using Html & Css as they are able to work in a single file without refering to any external source. Kind of the ‘avoid references to any external source’ that suprematism claims.
