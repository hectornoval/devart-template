Choosing the tools - (draft)

As suprematism found its base in the simplification on forms. I thought that to keep the process consistent in terms of 'concept' right up to the end the best way was to use basic coding languages. So I decided to build the méta-méta just with Html & Css as they can work in a single file without refering to any external source.

Kind of the ‘avoid references to any external source’ that suprematism claims.
